I would like to analyze and visualize the data for Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and answer the following questions for this dataset:
• What is the amount of yearly flight number and how it changed in years?
• What is the correlation between population growth and number of flights?
• What is the most destinations from BOS or an origin to BOS by visualization in
geographic map?
• Daily flight number grouped by month and compare with other years
• What is the daily rush hours for airport?
• What is the on-time/delay performance by years?
Using D3 and SVG, I will filter the US Domestic Flight Dataset for Boston Logan Airport. I am going to use amount of yearly flight number for 20 years and generate scatter plot visualization to see the yearly changes. I am going to use the same scatterplot to show population growth in twenty years with amount of yearly flight . In another visualization, I will create a choropleth map that shows the most popular destinations from BOS and an origin to BOS.
For exploration the dataset, I will put the yearly week-day total (Mo,Tu,We,... ) for many years and plot it in a heatmap. Visualization could show the change of daily amount of flight numbers in the years.
During my project, I am planning to do research and visualization about which airlines have used the Airport as a HUB and how it is changed in years.
